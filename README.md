Choose Installation Options

In the Visual Studio Code Setup wizard, I choose the destination folder where VS Code will be installed. The default location is usually C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code.
Optionally, you can select additional tasks such as creating a desktop icon or adding VS Code to the PATH for easier command-line access.
Install Visual Studio Code

Click on the "Next" button to begin the installation.
The installer will download necessary files and install Visual Studio Code on your system. This process may take a few moments depending on your internet connection speed.
Launch Visual Studio Code

Once the installation is complete, click on the "Finish" button to exit the installer.
I Can now launch Visual Studio Code by double-clicking the desktop icon or searching for "Visual Studio Code" in the Start menu.
Prerequisites
Before installing Visual Studio Code on Windows 11, ensure that your system meets the following prerequisites:

Operating System: Windows 11 (VS Code supports Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 as well)
Disk Space: Sufficient disk space for installation (typically around 300 MB)
RAM: Minimum 1 GB of RAM (recommended)
Internet Connection: Required for downloading the installer and updates during installation
By following these steps, you can download and install Visual Studio Code on your Windows 11 operating system and start using it for coding and development tasks.

2. First-time Setup:
   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.
   - Initial Setup for Visual Studio Code
Configure Settings

User Settings: Open VS Code and navigate to File > Preferences > Settings (or press Ctrl + ,). Adjust the following settings as needed:
Theme: Choose a theme under "Color Theme" (e.g., Dark+, Light+, or install a custom theme).
Font Size: Adjust the font size under "Editor: Font Size" for better readability.
Indentation: Set the indentation preferences (Editor: Tab Size and Editor: Insert Spaces) based on your coding style.
Auto Save: Configure auto-save preferences (Files: Auto Save) to onWindowChange or afterDelay to prevent losing changes.
Install Essential Extensions

Extensions enhance VS Code's functionality. Install essential extensions from the Extensions view (Ctrl + Shift + X):
Programming Language Support: Install extensions for your programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).
Debugger: Install the appropriate debugger extension (Debugger for Chrome, Python Extension, etc.) for debugging code.
Git Integration: Install the GitLens extension for enhanced Git integration and version control features.
Code Formatting: Install extensions like Prettier or ESLint for consistent code formatting.
File Icons: Optionally, install a file icon theme (Material Icon Theme, VSCode Icons) for visual distinction of file types.
Set Up Integrated Terminal

VS Code includes an integrated terminal for command-line tasks. Customize terminal settings (Terminal > Integrated: Shell Windows or Terminal: Integrated > Shell MacOS/Linux) to use your preferred shell (e.g., PowerShell, Bash).
Explore Keyboard Shortcuts

Review and customize keyboard shortcuts (File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts or Ctrl + K Ctrl + S). Familiarize yourself with default shortcuts and customize them according to your workflow.
Explore Command Palette

Use the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) to access various commands and settings in VS Code. This includes installing extensions, running tasks, and adjusting settings not readily available in the UI.
Optional: Workspace Settings

If you're working on a specific project, consider configuring workspace settings (File > Preferences > Settings > Workspace) separately from user settings. This allows project-specific configurations without affecting global settings.
Sync Settings (Optional)

Use the built-in Settings Sync feature (File > Preferences > Settings Sync) to sync your VS Code settings, extensions, and keybindings across different machines. Sign in with a Microsoft account to enable syncing.
